4. Queues
5. Hash Tables
6. Trees (Binary, AVL, and Red-Black)
7. Graphs
8. Tries
9. Heaps
10. Disjoint Set / Union-Find

Design Patterns:
1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype
6. Adapter
7. Bridge
8. Composite
9. Decorator
10. Facade
11. Flyweight
12. Proxy
13. Chain of Responsibility
14. Command
15. Interpreter
16. Iterator
17. Mediator
18. Memento
19. Observer
20. State
21. Strategy
22. Template Method
23. Visitor

Knowledge Areas:
1. Algorithm Design and Analysis
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
3. Functional Programming
4. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
5. Version Control (Git)
6. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
7. Debugging Techniques
8. System Design
9. Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
10. Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
11. Networking and Protocols
12. RESTful API Design
13. Security and Cryptography
14. Cloud Computing and Deployment
15. Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
16. Performance Optimization

First Week of Goals:
1. Choose a primary programming language (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, C++)
2. Familiarize yourself with the syntax and basic constructs of the chosen language
3. Practice implementing basic data structures and algorithms in your chosen language
4. Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) and learn basic commands
5. Start learning about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
6. Work on a small project to apply the learned concepts

Languages to Learn:
1. Python - Great for beginners, versatile, and widely used in the industry
2. Java - Widely used in enterprise applications, Android development, and has a strong ecosystem
3. JavaScript - Essential for web development, both front-end and back-end (Node.js)
4. C# - Used in the .NET framework, Unity game development, and Windows applications
5. C++ - High-performance applications, game development, and embedded systems

By mastering these concepts, patterns, and languages, you will be well on your way to becoming one of the best developers on the planet. Remember that consistent practice, staying up-to-date with new technologies, and working on real-world projects are essential to continuous growth in the field.
